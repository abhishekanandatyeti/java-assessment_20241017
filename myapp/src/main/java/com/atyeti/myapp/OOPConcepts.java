    /*
    Inheritance: 

    ->Inheritance is used for reusability of code.
    
    ->By using 'extends' Keyword we can inherit properties from parent to child.
    
    Polymorphism:

    ->As name suggests poly - many and morphism - forms solving same problem in many different ways.

    Two Types:

    1) Compile-Time Polymorphism
       Ex: Overloading

    2) Run-Time Polymorphism
       Ex: Overriding
    
    Encapsulation: Wrapping the data like capsule for data Security.

    1) We declare data using private Keyword. 
    ex: private int x;

    2) Using getters and setters we can access methods.
    ex: getScore, setScore
    
    Abstraction: Hinding the implementation and showing only requied information.

    1) interface is mostly used to achive abstraction 
    by using interface : helps in loosely coupling, final and public by default.
