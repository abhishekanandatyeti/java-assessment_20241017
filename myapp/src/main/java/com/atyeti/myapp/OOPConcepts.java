    /*
    Inheritance: Acquiring the properties from parent class to the child class.
    There are types of inheritance:
    >single inheritance
    >multiple inheritance
    >hybrid inheritance
    >hirarchial inheritance
    >multi level inheritance
    ex:children is going to inherit their father genes.
    
    Polymorphism:polymorphism is nothing but having more than one form.
    there are two types of polymorphism:
    >compiletime polymorphism and run time polymorphism:
    >compiletime polymorphism:execution is done at the time of compilation is called compile time polymorphism.
    >runtime polymorphism:execution is done at the run time is called runtime polymorphism.
    ex:a man can be a writer,teacher,doctor etc..
    
    Encapsulation: binding the data into the single unit is called encapsulation.
    >we can achieve encapsulation by using setters and getters.
    >by putting our instance variables private we can achieve encapsulation.
    there are two types:
    >tightly coupled encapsulation:we make our all the variables private then it is tightly encapsulated.
    >loosely coupled encapsulation:we make our few of our variables with public and some are private then it is loosely encapsulated.
    ex:Capsule:capsule is binded with the two parts

    
    Abstraction:
    Hiding the essentials details to the users by showing only the neccessary things.
    >we can achieve 100% abstraction by using Interface
    >we can achieve 0-100% by using abstraction.
    ex:car:we know how to drive the car but do not know the internal implementaion
