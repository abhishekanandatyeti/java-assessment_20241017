    /*
    Inheritance:  
        it allows new class inherit attributes and methods from the base class.it means creating a new class based on existing class
        example:  A dog can inherits from animal .
    
    polymorphism: polymorphism is ability to take many forms
    example: a girl can many role like a student ,mother,working women ..etc

    Encapsulation: it binds the data and member functions  in a  single unit.
    example :  The bag contains different stuffs like pen, pencil, notebook etc within it, 
    in order to get any stuff you need to open that bag it shows the bag only.
    
    Abstraction: abstraction is process hiding the internal details shows essential features only
    example:  you can drive a car without knowing how it move .
