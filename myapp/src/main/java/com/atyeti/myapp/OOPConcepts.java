    /*
    Inheritance: 
    Inheritance is one of the pillars of oop, by using inheritance
    we can use the methods and attributes of the parent class in the subclass
    Basically we use extend keyword along a class to implement the inheritance.

    for an ex. vehicle class inherits the start and stop methods in the subclass of different vehicle brands

    Polymorphism: 
    Polymorphism can be stated as the one which haves multiple
    behavior(poly means many and morph means behaviors)

    There are two types
    1.compile time polymorphism and
    2.runtime polymorphism
    overloading and overriding

    Encapsulation: 
    Encapsulation can be defined as binding of the methods and the data members. i.e encapsulating it.


    Abstraction:
    Abstraction can be defined as hiding the details and presenting only the necessary details.
    for an example we want to drive a want are requires to know how to start and stop the car, but we need
    not know the actual like how the car starts the ignition.
