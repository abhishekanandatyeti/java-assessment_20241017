    Inheritance:
               Inheritance is a process of accessing properties and functionality of other class i.e inheritance
               Type of Inheritance
               1) single inheritance:
                                  there is only one supper class and subclass i.e single inheritance.

               2)Multilevel inheritance:
                                    there is one class is extending to other class and that class is extending to other class i.e multilevel inheritance

               3)Hirarchical inheritance:
                                       There is one supper class and multiple sub classes i.e hirarchical inheritance.
    
    Polymorphism:
                Polymorphism is one name but many different from i.e polymorphism.

                Type of Polymorphism

                1)Method overloading:
                                 overloading is a method name is a same but parameter ane different.

                2)Method Overriding:
                               Overriding is a supper class method is implementing in a sub class. but it follows rule like method name is same, return type is same.
    
    Encapsulation:
               Encapsulation is a process of binding data in to single entity
               In Encapsulation class access is public but variable is private
               when we use this variable then create getter and setter method

    Abstraction:
              it is a process of hiding a functional thing and show only essential thing.

               we can achiving encapsulation in two ways

               1)Interface:
                        Interface having ony public abstract method
                        with the help of Interface we can achive 100 % abstraction

               2)Abstract method:
                              Abstract method having both the method
                              with the help of abstract method  we can achive 0 to 100 % abstraction
