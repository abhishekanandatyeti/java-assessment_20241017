    /*
    Inheritance: get the properties and behaviours from the parents classes 
        extends- for classes
        implements -for interface
        ex-realtoinships with father and grand father

        *single ,multilevel,multiple(interface) Inheritance
    
    Polymorphism: poly means many and mophism means forms it means a object behaves a differeently in different situatoins
        ex-men bahaves as a teacher,huband,father etc

        compile time plumorphism -over loading
        and runtime polymorphism-over riding 
    Encapsulation: wrapping of a data and code into a single unit
        for security
        ex-capsules

        setter and getter,tostring etc
    
    Abstraction:it hides the uncessary data in the System but it chows nessary data to us only
        ex-gmail- cannot see the indside code to the user they can see only the frontend only
        hiding the data and code to the end user...
