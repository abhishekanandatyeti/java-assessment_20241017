    - ArrayList:
               Arraylist implement list interface
               Arraylist is slower because lot of shifting process is there
               it uses dynamic array for storing the element
               it allows duplicate
               it maintain insertion order


    - LinkedList:
               it implement collection interface
               it uses doubly linked list to store the element we can insert and delete element bothof end
               it maintain insertion order
               it allows duplicate
               it implementation is faster because no shifting process is required

    - HashMap:
           HashMap implements map interface
           it uses hash table for storage
           it store a value based on key it must be unique
           duplication is not allowed
           it allows one null key and one null value
           it uses put method
